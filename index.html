		<h1>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</h1>

		<p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Saving the world with meals on wheels.</p>
		<p>You hit me with a cricket bat. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Annihilate? No. No violence. <strong> I won't stand for it.</strong> <em> Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!</em> I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>

		<p>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You hit me with a cricket bat. Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>

		<h3>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</h3>

		<p>You hit me with a cricket bat. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
		<p>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</p>
		<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>

		<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
